# unity SubSurface Scattering tutorial assets
Please note that this subsurface scattering effect works ONLY in HDRP.

Subsurface scattering works by simulating how light penetrates a translucent surface like skin and is absorbed and scattered and exits the surface at a different location

If you have opened the scene with sss, the teapot is probably green. To make the sss work you can just click on asset "sss test" and then press "ctrl" + "d". After doing it you can delete sss test and in the "teapotmaterial" in the diffusion profile section drag and drop "sss test 1" asset, then press fix and all should work now
